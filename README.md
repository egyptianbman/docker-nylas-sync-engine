# About

I found myself wasting a lot of time because the selection of nylas-sync-engine containers was not comprehensive and the ones that were available were constantly buggy. I set out making minor modifications to one, and ended up rewriting it from scratch.

This container aims to be as stable and with as few changes to the nylas setup process as possible.

Please see the [example](https://github.com/egyptianbman/docker-nylas-sync-engine/tree/master/example) directory for a usable "drop in" setup utilizing [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and the [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) container.
